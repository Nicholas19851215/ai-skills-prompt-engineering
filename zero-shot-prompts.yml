ai_response: Subject: Project Update: WhatsApp Integration – Revised Timeline

Dear Stakeholders,

I hope this message finds you well.

I’m writing to inform you of a revised timeline for the WhatsApp integration project. Due to unforeseen technical challenges, we will need to extend the delivery schedule by approximately two weeks.

What happened?
During the final stages of integration, our team encountered unexpected issues related to message routing and webhook stability. These required deeper investigation and adjustments to ensure the solution remains robust and scalable. While progress has been steady, resolving these challenges thoroughly is essential to avoid downstream disruptions.

Revised Timeline:

Original Go-Live: [Insert original date]
New Target Go-Live: [Insert new date, two weeks later]
Next Steps:

The engineering team is actively working on the fixes and will complete validation by [insert date].
We will share a revised deployment plan and updated documentation by [insert date].
A follow-up session will be scheduled to walk through the changes and confirm readiness.
We sincerely apologize for the delay and appreciate your understanding. Our priority remains delivering a stable and high-quality solution, and we’re confident this short extension will help us achieve that.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.

Warm regards,
Nicholas Naidoo
