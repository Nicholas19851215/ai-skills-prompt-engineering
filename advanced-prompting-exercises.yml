ai_response: WhatsApp Business API Integration – Requirements Document
1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the requirements for integrating the WhatsApp Business API into our customer service platform. The goal is to replace SMS-based communication with WhatsApp messaging, streamline inter-system communication via APIs, and enhance customer engagement through real-time, mobile-first interactions.

2. Technical Requirements
2.1 API Integration
Replace legacy bots with RESTful APIs for inter-system communication.
Implement webhook endpoints to receive status updates and trigger downstream processes.
Integrate with SPM and Purple Heron systems for claim updates and status synchronization 1.
2.2 Message Flow
Send WhatsApp links to customers for self-service actions (e.g., vehicle assessments).
Capture and store customer responses and media securely.
Ensure message delivery tracking and error handling.
2.3 Authentication & Access Control
Use OAuth 2.0 or token-based authentication for API endpoints.
Role-based access for internal users managing WhatsApp interactions.
2.4 Event Hub Integration
Utilize Event Hub for centralized event processing and message queuing 1.
3. Integration Architecture
Components:

WhatsApp Business API Gateway
Customer Service Platform (SPM, Foggy, Purple Heron)
Event Hub (for webhook and event processing)
Agent Dashboard Interface
Customer Mobile Devices
Security Layer (Token validation, encryption)
Data Flow:

Customer sends message → WhatsApp API
Webhook triggers → Event Hub → SPM
Agent responds via dashboard → WhatsApp API
Updates sync with Purple Heron and Foggy
4. User Stories for Customer Service Agents
Story 1:
As a customer service agent, I want to receive WhatsApp messages in my dashboard so that I can respond to customer queries in real time.

Story 2:
As an agent, I want to view the customer’s claim status and history alongside the WhatsApp conversation so that I can provide accurate support.

Story 3:
As a supervisor, I want to monitor WhatsApp interactions for SLA compliance and escalate unresolved issues.

5. Security and Compliance Considerations
All messages and media must be encrypted in transit and at rest.
Webhook endpoints must be secured with IP whitelisting and token validation.
Data retention policies must comply with POPIA and internal governance.
Audit logs must be maintained for all message exchanges and API calls.
