  A WhatsApp integration is experiencing intermittent message delivery failures (about 15% of messages fail). Walk me through a systematic debugging approach:
  
  1. Start by identifying what information you need to gather
  2. Explain how you would reproduce the issue
  3. Describe the step-by-step investigation process
  4. Detail how you would isolate the root cause
  5. Outline potential solutions and how to validate them
  6. Explain how you would prevent this issue in the future
  
  Be thorough in explaining your reasoning at each step.

# Cost Optimization Analysis
prompt: |
  Your WhatsApp Business API costs have increased by 300% this month. Analyze this step by step:
  
  1. First, identify what data you need to collect to understand the cost increase
  2. Then, analyze potential causes (traffic spike, pricing changes, inefficient usage, etc.)
  3. Evaluate each potential cause based on likelihood and impact
  4. Propose specific investigation steps for the most likely causes
  5. Suggest optimization strategies for each identified issue
  6. Prioritize solutions based on effort vs. impact

# Security Risk Assessment
prompt: |
  A new team member suggests storing WhatsApp webhook secrets in environment variables on the production server. Evaluate this proposal step by step:
  
  1. First, identify what security principles are at stake
  2. Analyze the current proposal's security implications
  3. Consider potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities
  4. Evaluate alternative approaches and their trade-offs
  5. Factor in operational complexity and team capabilities
  6. Make a recommendation with supporting rationale
  7. Suggest implementation steps if changes are needed
  
  Walk through your security analysis systematically.

# Performance Optimization
prompt: |
  Your WhatsApp integration handles 1000 messages/hour, but you need to scale to 10,000 messages/hour. Think through an optimization strategy:
  
  1. Start by analyzing current performance bottlenecks
  2. Identify which components will hit limits first
  3. Consider different scaling approaches (vertical vs horizontal)
  4. Evaluate the impact on system reliability and complexity
  5. Factor in cost implications of each approach
  6. Plan implementation phases to minimize risk
  7. Define success metrics and monitoring strategy
  
  Show your complete reasoning for each optimization decision.
ai_response: System Architecture Decision: REST vs GraphQL for WhatsApp Integration
Requirements Analysis
WhatsApp integration involves sending and receiving messages, handling webhooks, managing templates, and tracking delivery statuses. These operations are transactional and often involve well-defined data structures.

REST vs GraphQL Comparison

REST: Simple, resource-based endpoints (e.g., /messages, /templates). Ideal for predictable operations like sending a message or receiving a status update.
GraphQL: Allows clients to specify exactly what data they need. Useful for complex queries but may be overkill for WhatsApp’s mostly fixed payloads.
Trade-offs

Performance: REST is faster for simple operations; GraphQL can reduce over-fetching but adds parsing overhead.
Complexity: REST is easier to implement and debug. GraphQL requires schema design and resolver logic.
Maintainability: REST endpoints are easier to version and document. GraphQL can be harder to manage as schema evolves.
Team Expertise & Infrastructure
The team has existing REST-based services and monitoring tools. Introducing GraphQL would require training and infrastructure changes.

Recommendation
Use REST for the WhatsApp integration service. It aligns with the transactional nature of WhatsApp APIs, is easier to maintain, and fits the team’s current skill set.

✅ Debugging Strategy: Intermittent WhatsApp Message Failures
Information Gathering
Collect logs, error codes, timestamps, recipient metadata, and API response payloads. Check message queue stats and retry attempts.

Reproduction Strategy
Simulate message sending during peak and off-peak hours. Use test accounts and monitor delivery outcomes.

Investigation Steps

Check API rate limits and error codes
Review webhook logs for failed callbacks
Analyze message payloads for formatting issues
Inspect retry logic and timeout settings
Root Cause Isolation
Correlate failures with time, recipient type, or message content. Use tracing tools to follow message flow across services.

Solutions & Validation

Add exponential backoff for retries
Improve logging granularity
Validate payloads before dispatch
Test fixes in staging and monitor delivery success rate
Prevention
Set up alerting for failure spikes, implement automated retries, and conduct regular load testing.

✅ Cost Optimization Analysis: WhatsApp API Cost Spike
Data Collection
Gather usage logs, message volume, template types, recipient regions, and billing breakdowns.

Potential Causes

Traffic spike
Pricing tier change
Inefficient retries
Unused templates triggering charges
Evaluation

Traffic spike: High likelihood, check campaign logs
Pricing change: Check provider announcements
Inefficient usage: Review retry logic and template usage
Investigation Steps

Compare month-over-month usage
Audit retry patterns
Review template approval and usage logs
Optimization Strategies

Consolidate templates
Limit retries with smarter logic
Use session messages where possible
Negotiate pricing with provider
Prioritization

Retry logic fix: Low effort, high impact
Template audit: Medium effort, medium impact
Pricing negotiation: High effort, long-term impact
Monitoring Plan
Set up dashboards for usage and cost tracking. Alert on anomalies and review monthly.

✅ Security Risk Assessment: Webhook Secrets in Environment Variables
Security Principles
Confidentiality, integrity, and least privilege.

Proposal Analysis
Environment variables are better than hardcoding but still vulnerable to exposure via logs or misconfigurations.

Attack Vectors

Insider access to server
Misconfigured logging
Compromised CI/CD pipeline
Alternatives

Use a secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault)
Encrypt secrets at rest and in transit
Operational Complexity
Secrets manager adds setup overhead but improves security. Team may need training.

Recommendation
Use a secrets manager for production. Environment variables are acceptable for local dev only.

Implementation Steps

Migrate secrets to vault
Update deployment scripts
Audit access controls
Document retrieval process
✅ Performance Optimization: Scaling WhatsApp Integration
Current Bottlenecks
Message queue throughput, API rate limits, webhook processing latency.

Component Limits

Message dispatcher
Database writes
Webhook listener concurrency
Scaling Approaches

Vertical: Increase server specs
Horizontal: Add worker nodes, use load balancers
Reliability & Complexity
Horizontal scaling improves fault tolerance but adds orchestration complexity.

Cost Implications
Horizontal scaling costs more upfront but scales better long-term.

Implementation Plan

Phase 1: Optimize code and queues
Phase 2: Add horizontal workers
Phase 3: Load test and monitor
Success Metrics

99% delivery within 5 seconds
<1% failure rate
Scalable to 10,000 messages/hour
