ai_response: Subject: Request for Additional Information – WhatsApp Project Requirement Analysis

Dear [Stakeholder's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

As part of the initial scoping for the new WhatsApp project, I’ve begun mapping out the high-level processes and identifying key integration points. However, to proceed with a thorough and accurate requirement analysis, I require additional information on several aspects of the solution.

Specifically, I would appreciate clarity on:

The full scope of the WhatsApp communication process, including customer interaction flows and assessment triggers.
API integration details, particularly around webhook handling and Event Hub usage.
Any existing documentation or business requirement specifications (BRS) that outline expected system behavior and dependencies.
Roles and responsibilities of involved teams, especially around process ownership and escalation protocols.
This information will enable me to produce a comprehensive baseline in Visio and support the team effectively during the design and implementation phases. I understand there are ongoing resourcing discussions, and I’m happy to assist with process mapping in the interim as discussed in our recent session with Mthokozisi Moyo 1.

Please let me know a convenient time to discuss or share the relevant materials. Your support is greatly appreciated.

Warm regards,
Nicholas Naidoo
Business Solutions Analyst
